Some attributes to make some field drawing easier

- `MinMax` Use on a vector2 to define a min/max from the inspector
- `ReadOnly` Use to define that a field is readonly. Additional parameters to dictate if this is active in and/or out of playmode
- `SortingLayer` Use on int fields to draw a dropdown for picking among the sorting layers defined in the project
- `SpriteRender` Use on sprite fields to draw a preview image of the sprite with a checkerboard background
- `AudioClipButtons` Use this to draw some buttons to test audio clips from the AudioClip field itself.

My personal utilities library package.  
This will gradually gain updates as it sees fit during personal project developments.  
This package would contain general functionality that can be applied to any Unity project.

In particular, there are some notable tools:
- Centralized asset display window
- Save/Load system with interactive data editor window and version migration
- Build version auto-incrementation and easy zipping
- And many various utility scripts

I document the classes here, so it should be understandable.

## Disclaimer
- I don't regard compatibility or the Unity version, so beware!
- The API could and will change at any moment's notice.
- This package will change the supported unity version at any moment's notice, but will usually stay current with the latest tech stream. 
- In most cases, older Unity versions should work but are not actively supported.

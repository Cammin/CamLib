My personal utilities package.  
This will gradually gain updates as it seems fit during personal project developments.  
This package would contain general functionality that can apply to any Unity project.

In particular, there's some notable tools:
- Centralized asset display window
- Save/Load system with interactive data editor window
- Build version auto-incrementation and easy zipping
- And many various utility scripts

## Disclaimer
- I don't give any regard to compatibility or unity version, so beware!
- The API could and will change at any moments notice.
- This package will change the supported unity version at any moment's notice, but will usually stay up to date with the latest tech stream. 
- In most cases, older Unity versions should work, but are not actively supported.
